This project demonstrates **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) Routing** configured in **Cisco Packet Tracer** for efficient network communication.  

# Project Overview  
1 **Main Branch Router** connected to **4 Branch Routers**  
Each router is linked to a **switch & PC**  
**OSPF Routing** configured for dynamic communication  

# Key Configurations  
- OSPF Process & Network Statements  
- IP Addressing & Subnetting  
- Routing Verification & Troubleshooting  

# Files Included  
- **OSPF-Project.pkt** (Packet Tracer file)

2. Open **OSPF-Project.pkt** in **Cisco Packet Tracer**.
